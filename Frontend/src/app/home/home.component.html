    We train children to think out of the box and effectively use the resources
    at hand to come up with outstanding solutions of the future. The SOLE
    concept, proposed by Dr.Sugata Mitra, aims to do this exactly by using the
    curiosity and “all-is-possible” attitude which all children inherently
    possess, to not only make learning fun, but to help them imbibe the
    necessary skills needed for the 21st century. We then analyse their dominant
    learning style by a VARK questionnaire, to help the teacher identify helpful
    resources for a better learning experience.
