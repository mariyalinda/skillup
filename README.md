# SkillUp Kids!
In this time of remote learning amidst the pandemic, while a new world of technology and upskilling opened up to adults and older kids, one section of the society that has been left behind and severely neglected is younger children in the age group 6 - 10. Learning was often monotonous, with children forced to stare continuously into their laptops or phones, tuning into a one way lecture:computer: thus losing their curiosity, motivation and most importantly the fun involved in learning:woman_teacher: 

My idea aims to use this very curiosity and “all-is-possible” attitude which all children inherently possess:sparkles: to not only make learning fun, but to help them imbibe the necessary skills needed for the 21st century. Gone are the days when good handwriting and memory skills helped kids crack an exam, as in the present age, the internet can give us answers to any question within less than a minute:zap:

Thus children must be trained to think out of the box and effectively use the resources at hand to come up with outstanding solutions in the future. This is where the SOLE concept, proposed by Dr.Sugata Mitra comes into play. Also, the dominant learning style of the child is analysed by a VARK questionnaire, to help the teacher identify helpful resources for a better learning experience:partying_face:
